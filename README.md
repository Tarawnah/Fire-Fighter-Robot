The aim of this fire-fighting robot is to autonomously steer towards detected fire, moves straight when facing a fire, and accurately sprays water when it's close to the fire, with the servo motor directing the hose. An IR sensor prevents collisions with obstacles during straight movements. The integrated design ensures effective and cautious responses to diverse firefighting scenarios. The smart firefighting car features three flame sensors, an IR sensor, PIC 16F877A microcontroller, three 3.7V batteries, and a water system with a tank, pump, and servo motor.
